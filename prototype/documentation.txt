31 Oct.
  * Base project built with four buttons and confirmed to be working.
  * Deviation from project deadlines due to school activities (CS 375 midterm).
  * The author takes note that Java's (in Processing) weakly typed variables and "willy-nilly" method of variable declartion make the code
    hard to read.
  * Begin the process of learning the Window's API.

1 Nov.
  * Successfully testing getting and sending keyboard/mouse inputs with the Windows API.

8 Nov.
  * Got a C++ program to send input, and thus control, an external program
  * Noted limitations are that the program must be the foreground window to receive the input
  * Will attempt to send input via Windows messages and the window handle at a later date
  * Much progress made in learning the Windows API
  * Debating on whether to use the Windows API alone or the whole Win32 interface
  * The last of the required hardware arrived.
