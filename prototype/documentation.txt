31 Oct.
  * Base project built with four buttons and confirmed to be working.
  * Deviation from project deadlines due to school activities (CS 375 midterm).
  * The author takes note that Java's (in Processing) weakly typed variables and "willy-nilly" method of variable declartion make the code
    hard to read.
  * Begin the process of learning the Window's API.

1 Nov.
  * Successfully testing getting and sending keyboard/mouse inputs with the Windows API.

8 Nov.
  * Got a C++ program to send input, and thus control, an external program
  * Noted limitations are that the program must be the foreground window to receive the input
  * Will attempt to send input via Windows messages and the window handle at a later date
  * Much progress made in learning the Windows API
  * Debating on whether to use the Windows API alone or the whole Win32 interface
  * The last of the required hardware arrived.

14 Nov.
  * Additional hardware arrived
  * Integrated additional hardware into the project
  * All new inputs confirmed working

14-26 Nov.
  * Spent the majority of the time testing various elements of the Windows and Win32 APIs

26 Nov.
  * Working C++ program getting data over serial COM port

27 Nov.
  * Successfully got the window handle via window title and stored it. This allows for the focus on the window to be lost while still sending messages to it.
  
28 Nov.
  * Finished all testing for COM communication with Arduino
  * Showing all available COM ports in friendly names for user selection
  * Begin integrating concepts from tests into a central project

29 Nov.
  * Begin work on final hardware configuration
  * Successfully inputting all needed data into external program via Windows API

30 Nov.
  * Finish all hardware implementation, final design decided upon and completed
  * Arduino code for final hardware design completed, no further revisions expected
  * Begin work on processing serial input on intermediate C++ program
  * Begin work on mapping serial input data to outgoing key commands
  
1 Dec.
  * Changed method of Arduino output to integral type instead of character type to reduce errors and increase speed
  * Changed C++ program to match Arduino data

2 Dec.
  * Basic formation of the final data path Arduino->C++->Windows Program is done
  * Testing and debugging of data transfer

3 Dec.
  * Project in complete working order, no known bugs left
